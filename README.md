Thoughts behind Query 1:
By figuring out how many runs I do out of all the activities total (which includes swims, bikes, ellipticals, walks, etc.), 
I can see the load and stress on my legs. Essentially, I can find the ratio of runs to cross training methods, analyzing the strain on my legs.

Thoughts behind Query 2:
There is overwhelming evidence to conclude that injuries are significantly more likely to happen if you do a workout or run that exceeds 10% more volume than your previous longest run to date. By keeping track of this metric, I can see if doing a sepcific run increases my risk to injury, staying on track for a healthy and productive training block.

Thoughts behind Query 3:
As I continue my career, building more mileage as I get stronger and grow in the sport, the average length of my runs will increase. With this code, I will be able to check on my progress as I handle more volume.

Thoughts behind Query 4:
Even though individual runs will vary in the metric of heart rate, this code will allow me to check on if my heart rate is changing over time or staying consistent. This way, I know that if I'm running faster, but my heart rate stays the same, my aerobic fitness is changing in the right direction. This can also be use similarly for finding the opposite trend.

Thoughts behind Query 5: 
This allows me to see the calories burned per run. This is very important as this will tell me the MINIMUM amount of calories I will have to eat in order to sustain my current activity level. Fueling and eating enough is crucial for peak performance for endurance athletes, and this gives great information on how to have healthy and successful eating habits.

Thoughts behind Query 6: 
This code is really insightful, because as time continues, hopefully the average pace goes down. I will also be able to monitor this to see if factors like, nutrition, volume, lifting habits, sleep duration, and other things change the speed of my runs. 

Thoughts behind Query 7:
With this code, I will be able to see if elevation plays a role in my training. When transitioning from runs when I'm at school from summer break and vice versa, I will be able to see how different terrain affects my training.

Thoughts behind Query 8: 
As my fitness improves, hopefully the runs brought by this code will change. If things are going as planned, these runs should change as my body acclimates to harder runs. This way, I will be able to analyze my progress.

Thoughts behind Query 9:
When fitness grows, so will my stride length. When multiplying these, the average distance will come out, and I will, once again, be able to track this metric over time.
