Thoughts behind Query 1:
By figuring out how many runs I do out of all the activities total (which includes swims, bikes, ellipticals, walks, etc.), 
I can see the load and stress on my legs. Essentially, I can find the ratio of runs to cross training methods, analyzing the strain on my legs.

Thoughts behind Query 2:
There is overwhelming evidence to conclude that injuries are significantly more likely to happen if you do a workout or run that exceeds 10% more volume than your previous longest run to date. By keeping track of this metric, I can see if doing a sepcific run increases my risk to injury, staying on track for a healthy and productive training block.
